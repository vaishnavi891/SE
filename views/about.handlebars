      <span class="subtitle" id="text">Welcome to
        <strong>Harmonii</strong>,
<p class="p1"><b>Our Mission</b></p>
<p>Mental health matters â€” and yet, many people still face their struggles in silence. Our mission is to create a safe, supportive, and accessible space for anyone facing mental health challenges. We believe no one should feel alone in their journey toward healing.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Why We Started</b></p>
<p>Mental health issues are becoming more common in todayâ€™s fast-paced world. Many people feel lonely, overwhelmed, and stressed, especially when help is hard to find or too expensive. In some communities, in-person support is not even available. Even worse, the stigma around mental health keeps people from reaching out. We created this platform to break the silence, fight stigma, and make help more accessible.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>What We Offer</b></p>
<p>We offer a space where individuals can:

Share their recovery stories to inspire and connect with others.

Learn from shared experiences and discover ways to cope.

Access helpful resources, self-care tips, and professional advice.

Join a supportive community that listens without judgment.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>Why It Matters</b></p>
<p>Many people who suffer from mental health challenges feel alone and misunderstood. By creating a platform for open conversation, weâ€™re helping people realize they are not alone â€” and that healing is possible when we share, support, and learn from one another.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Join Us</b></p>
<p>Whether you're here to listen, to learn, or to share your own story, we welcome you. Together, we can build a world where mental health is talked about freely, and support is always just a click away.</span></p>

      <span class="title t1">Purpose</span><br />
      <span class="subtitle">Mental health is a critical component of overall
        health and wellbeing. According to the World Health Organization, mental
        health is defined as a state of well-being in which an individual can
        realize their own potential, cope with the normal stresses of life, work
        productively, and contribute to their community. Unfortunately, mental
        health problems are all too common, with an estimated 1 in 4 people
        worldwide experiencing mental health issues at some point in their
        lives.
        <br /><br />
        The consequences of poor mental health can be devastating, affecting
        every aspect of a person's life from their relationships and work to
        their physical health and overall quality of life. However, the good
        news is that with the right support and tools, individuals can take
        steps to improve their mental health and wellbeing.
        <br /><br />
        Our mental health application aims to provide those tools and support,
        helping individuals to track their mental health, manage their
        medications, and stay on top of their wellbeing. By using our
        application, individuals can take proactive steps to promote better
        mental health and wellbeing, and work towards achieving their full
        potential in life.
        <br /><br />
        By prioritizing mental health and using tools like our mental health
        application, we can all work towards a healthier, happier future.</span>
